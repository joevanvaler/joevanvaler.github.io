    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Joseph Mitchell Van Valer. Indianian.
        Not to be confused with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith">Joseph Smith</a>,
        founder of the Mormon church, though Alex could probably still hear the judgement from here... Math
        genius <s>struggling through</s> taking Foundations of Analysis as a freshman (okay math major). Comes from a
        prodigy family. Third(?) generation legacy student + son of faculty at IU School of Medicine, but still spends
        half his time looking up stats about other med schools (though, he did have an identity crisis when he wanted to
        switch to a statistics phd once -- it wasn't pretty). 2nd best juggler in Purdue juggling club history. Tetris
        god (it's a lifestyle). Legendary unicyclist.<br><br>

        And, of course, bicycle maniac sometimes.<br><br>

        Happy birthday Joe <3<br>
